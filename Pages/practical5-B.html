    <p style="background-color: aqua; color:white ;font-size: x-large;">Bootstrap is the best HTML, CSS and JavaScript framework for any web 
        developer. It will help you quickly produce responsive, clean looking websites. It does this simply by providing you with a 
        ton of pre-built CSS and JavaScript for lists, navigation bars, forms and lots of other web elements. With Bootstrap you can 
        focus more on the website you wanted, and spend less time wrestling with some of the CSS issues, media queries, and 
        cross-browser compatibility.</p>

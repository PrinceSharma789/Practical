    <p style="background-color: aqua; color:white ; font-size: x-large;">JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and 
        most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and make 
        dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented capabilities. JavaScript was first known as 
        LiveScript, but Netscape changed its name to JavaScript, possibly because of the excitement being generated by Java. JavaScript 
        made its first appearance in Netscape 2.0 in 1995 with the name LiveScript. The general-purpose core of the language has been 
        embedded in Netscape, Internet Explorer, and other web browsers.</p>
